# Codes

## Data

DCN-DOA/Data/matlib

Data are created with matlab, which did not be reprodeced.

## Original code

DCN-DOA/OriginalCodes/DCN_DOA/Train&Test

## Reproduced

1. CodesReproduction/DCN-DOA/ReproducedCodes
2. DCN-DOA/DEEPDOA
3. DCN-DOA/Remake

Codes 1 are ran with JupyterNotebook, which are produced while learning thesis, so could be complex.

Codes 2 are gathered on the Internet.

Codes 3 are .py file, which are remade simpler from codes 1.
